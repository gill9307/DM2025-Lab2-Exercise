      "**Key Concepts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include customer transaction records, website logs, sensor data, social media feeds, scientific experiment results, and much more.\n",
      "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, correlations, anomalies, and relationships within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain observed phenomena.\n",

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the discovered knowledge into practice. This could involve integrating it into business processes, creating reports, or building predictive models.\n",

      "Data mining employs a variety of techniques, often drawing from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Some of the most common include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

       "*   **Underlying Assets:** Futures contracts can be written on a wide range of assets, including:\n",
       "    *   **Commodities:** Oil, gold, corn, wheat, livestock\n",
       "    *   **Financial Instruments:** Stock indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq), currencies, interest rates, government bonds\n",
       "*   **Purpose:**\n",

       "\n",
       "An **options contract** gives the buyer the **right, but not the obligation**, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiration date). The seller of the option is obligated to fulfill the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise their right.\n",

       "*   **Premium:** The buyer pays a price called a **premium** to the seller for the right granted by the option. This premium is the maximum amount the buyer can lose.\n",
       "*   **Strike Price:** The predetermined price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold.\n",
       "*   **Expiration Date:** The date by which the option must be exercised.\n",
       "*   **Two Types of Options:**\n",
       "    *   **Call Option:** Gives the buyer the right to **buy** the underlying asset at the strike price. Buyers of call options expect the price of the underlying asset to rise.\n",
       "    *   **Put Option:** Gives the buyer the right to **sell** the underlying asset at the strike price. Buyers of put options expect the price of the underlying asset to fall.\n",
       "*   **Underlying Assets:** Similar to futures, options can be written on a wide range of assets, including stocks, stock indices, commodities, currencies, and bonds.\n",
       "*   **Purpose:**\n",
       "    *   **Hedging:** Investors can use options to protect their portfolios from potential losses. For example, buying put options on a stock they own can limit their downside risk.\n",
       "    *   **Speculation:** Traders can speculate on price movements with limited risk (the premium paid).\n",
       "    *   **Income Generation:** Sellers of options (writers) collect premiums, which can be a source of income, but they take on the obligation and potential for unlimited losses (in the case of uncovered calls).\n",

       "### **Introduction: The World of Derivatives**\n",
       "\n",
       "Both options and futures are types of **derivative contracts**. This means their value is *derived* from an underlying asset. This underlying asset can be a stock, a commodity (like oil or gold), a currency, a stock market index (like the S&P 500), or even an interest rate.\n",
       "\n",
       "These instruments were originally created for **hedging**—a way for producers and consumers of a commodity to manage price risk. However, they are now widely used for **speculation** (betting on future price movements) and **arbitrage** (exploiting price discrepancies).\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **1. Futures Contracts: The Obligation**\n",
       "\n",
       "A futures contract is a standardized legal agreement to **buy or sell** a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "The key word here is **obligation**. When you enter into a futures contract, you are legally bound to fulfill your side of the deal.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **How It Works: An Analogy**\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine a wheat farmer who will have a harvest ready in three months. She is worried that the price of wheat might fall by then. At the same time, a large bakery is worried that the price of wheat might rise, increasing its costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The **farmer (the seller)** can enter into a futures contract to **sell** her wheat in three months at today's agreed-upon price, say $8 per bushel. This is known as taking a **short position**.\n",
       "*   The **bakery (the buyer)** can enter into a futures contract to **buy** that wheat in three months at the same $8 per bushel. This is known as taking a **long position**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both parties have now locked in a price, eliminating uncertainty. If the market price of wheat in three months drops to $6, the farmer is protected. If it rises to $10, the bakery is protected. One party gains relative to the market price, and the other loses, but both have achieved price certainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Key Characteristics of Futures:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Standardization:** Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges (like the CME Group). Everything is standardized: the quantity of the asset (e.g., 5,000 bushels of corn), the quality, the delivery date, and location. This standardization allows for high liquidity.\n",
       "*   **Leverage and Margin:** You don't pay the full value of the contract upfront. Instead, both buyer and seller must post a performance bond known as **margin**. This is a fraction of the contract's value, which creates significant leverage. A small price movement can lead to large gains or losses relative to the margin posted.\n",
       "*   **Marking-to-Market:** This is a critical concept. At the end of every trading day, the exchange settles all open positions. If the contract price went up, money is moved from the short position's margin account to the long's. If it went down, the reverse happens. This daily settlement prevents large losses from accumulating.\n",
       "*   **Physical vs. Cash Settlement:** While some futures (like commodities) can result in the physical delivery of the asset, most financial futures (like on the S&P 500) are **cash-settled**. This means the net profit or loss is simply paid in cash at expiration.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **2. Options Contracts: The Right, Not the Obligation**\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "*   If you discover the house is worth much more than the agreed price, you will **exercise your option** and buy it.\n",
       "*   If you find a better house or the market crashes, you can simply walk away. Your only loss is the initial deposit (the premium). You are not obligated to buy the house.\n",

       "#### **Types of Options:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Call Option:** Gives the holder the right to **buy** the underlying asset. You would buy a call if you are **bullish** and believe the asset's price will rise.\n",

       "\n",
       "For every option buyer, there is an option **seller (the writer)**. The seller receives the premium upfront but takes on the obligation to sell (for a call) or buy (for a put) the asset if the buyer chooses to exercise the option.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Key Characteristics of Options:**\n",

       "| **Profit Profile** | Linear and symmetric. A $1 price move results in a $1 gain for one party and a $1 loss for the other. | Non-linear. The buyer's profit potential is unlimited, while their loss is capped. |\n",
       "| **Daily Settlement** | **Marked-to-market daily.** Profits and losses are realized in the margin account each day. | The value of the premium changes, but there is no daily cash settlement. The final profit/loss is realized upon selling the option or at expiration. |\n",
       "| **Primary Use Case** | Primarily used for direct hedging to lock in a future price and for speculation on the direction of price. | Used for more flexible hedging, speculation, generating income (selling options), and creating complex strategies with defined risk. |\n",

       "### **Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the fundamental difference lies in the nature of the commitment:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   A **Futures contract** is a binding **obligation** for both parties, akin to a firm commitment to transact in the future. It is a tool for locking in prices.\n",
       "*   An **Options contract** is a flexible **choice** for the buyer, paid for with a premium. It is a tool for managing risk with a defined downside, allowing participation in favorable price movements while being protected from adverse ones.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both are powerful instruments in modern finance, but their risk profiles and strategic applications are fundamentally different. Understanding this distinction between obligation and right is the cornerstone of mastering derivatives."

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n",
    "*   The **attributes** of the class (e.g., `topic_name`, `sub_title`) become the keys in the final JSON object.\n",
    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\n\"Zootopia 2\" \\nThe kids will really give thanks for this animated sequel. Watered down? Maybe. \\nBut it’s a party invitation no one will refuse. \\nBy Peter Travers \\nNov 28, 2025 \\n \\nThe first “Zootopia” won an Oscar as best animated feature nearly a decade ago. \\nAnyone for seconds? The sequel, with 18 new and returning characters, has the \\nsame surging comic energy, eye-popping colors and irresistible impulse to party \\nsure to bring family audiences out in droves. Can “Zootopia 2” take down \\njuggernaut “Wicked: For Good” at the Thanksgiving weekend box office? I \\nwouldn’t bet against it. \\nWhat “Zootopia 2” doesn’t have that the first one delivered big time is an itch to \\nbreak the rules and paint outside the marshmallow box. That first Z baby about \\nanimal cops and robbers, had attitude, a potent feminist streak, a tough take on \\nracism, and a cinema-centric plot that referenced “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” \\nand “L.A. Confidential.” The kids rightly paid zero attention, but the grownups \\nwho tagged along appreciated the effort. “Zootopia 2” is way more cautious \\nabout tampering with a potential goldmine. The new timidity is not a \\ndealbreaker—the sequel earns its stripes as a laugh-a-minute hot ticket—but I \\nmiss the risk. \\nThe sequel feels safer than the original and I’m sorry about that. But ‘Zootopia 2’ \\nwith its zippity-doo animation and surprises around every corner gets the job \\ndone. \\nAnd now on to the good stuff. Yes, both the leads are back. There’s irresistible \\nGinnifer Goodwin voicing Judy Hopps, a farm rabbit with 225 siblings who’s now \\na kickass cop in Zootopia, a gorgeously designed barnyard metropolis where \\npredators and prey live in segregated harmony. I didn’t say peace; the town isn’t \\nperfect.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nEnter snarkmeister Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde, a scammer of a fox who’s \\nreformed so much that he too is now a cop, playing naughty to Judy’s nice. \\nThere’s some flirting to suggest a mixed-species connection. But this isn’t a \\nNetflix holidays romcom. And they bicker up a storm, like Blake Lively and Justin \\nBaldoni behind the scenes on “It Ends with Us.” \\n \\nSomething must be done, so Chief Bogo (a cape buffalo again voiced by Idris \\nElba) orders them to a “partners in crisis” workshop led by Dr. Fuzzby (Quinta \\nBrunson) a therapy quokka. \\nThis sounds a bit conventional, compared to the first movie when predators \\nreverted to nature and went on snarling, violent attacks that were savage enough \\nto make impressionable tots hide under their seats. Also, there are fewer movie \\nreferences, though a chase through a hedge maze has a chilly “Shining” vibe. \\nYou’ll be pleased to know there is a villain. So come on down Gary De’Snake, a \\nreptile graced with the vocal chops of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Oscar \\nwinner Ke Huy Quan. But hold the hisses. Gary doesn’t slither with evil for long. \\nSee it turns out that Gary only wants to restore the reputation of his family and \\nother vipers who feel slimed by cancel culture. \\nThings converge at a Zootennial Gala, celebrating 100 years since the city\\'s \\nfounding. The party is hosted by a family of lynxes who are descendants of \\nZootopia\\'s founder, Ebeneezer Lynxley. Judy befriends young Pawbert Lynxley \\n(Andy Samberg) and his daddy, Milton (shaded with just the right degree of \\nsuspicion by David Strathairn). \\nThe plot is a needlessly complicated affair about weather walls—each animal \\nspecies needs its own weather—and who owns the patent. Wait, what! A kiddie \\ncomedy about patent law? Yawn, right. Hold on. Soon Judy and Nick are being \\nframed as accomplices. They get help from Nibbles Maplestick (a scene stealing \\nFortune Feimster), a beaver conspiracy theory podcaster who knows where the \\nbodies are buried in this deceptively happy town. \\nSo “Zootopia 2,” directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard—Bush did the\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 3**\\n\"\"\"\\nscript— puts Judy and Nick on a race to clear their names. Some mystery, as if \\nwe didn’t know the outcome. It doesn’t matter. Not really. Not when Bush and \\nHoward keep the action hopping with characters we’ve come to know and love. \\nEven Gary De’Snake. All the voice actors have a blast cutting loose, even Shakira \\nwho returns as the pop star Gazelle, with a new song called “Zoo” that seems \\nbuilt for endless kiddie streaming. \\nDitto the movie. OK, the sequel feels safer than the original and I’m sorry about \\nthat. But “Zootopia 2” with its zippity-doo animation and surprises around every \\ncorner gets the job done. The delight and dazzle of this family-friendly follow-up \\nis undeniable, bringing it all home in a climax that should have audiences \\npanting for a “Z3.” Forgive my Nick-like snark, but hasn’t that been the point all \\nalong?\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
