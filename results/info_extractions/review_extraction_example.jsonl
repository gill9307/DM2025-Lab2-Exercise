this animated sequel. Watered down? Maybe. \nBut it’s a party invitation no one will refuse. \nBy Peter Travers \nNov 28, 2025 \n \nThe first “Zootopia” won an Oscar as best animated feature nearly a decade ago. \nAnyone for seconds? The sequel, with 18 new and returning characters, has the \nsame surging comic energy, eye-popping colors and irresistible impulse to party \nsure to bring family audiences out in droves. Can “Zootopia 2” take down \njuggernaut “Wicked: For Good” at the Thanksgiving weekend box office? I \nwouldn’t bet against it. \nWhat “Zootopia 2” doesn’t have that the first one delivered big time is an itch to \nbreak the rules and paint outside the marshmallow box. That first Z baby about \nanimal cops and robbers, had attitude, a potent feminist streak, a tough take on \nracism, and a cinema-centric plot that referenced “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” \nand “L.A. Confidential.” The kids rightly paid zero attention, but the grownups \nwho tagged along appreciated the effort. “Zootopia 2” is way more cautious \nabout tampering with a potential goldmine. The new timidity is not a \ndealbreaker—the sequel earns its stripes as a laugh-a-minute hot ticket—but I \nmiss the risk. \nThe sequel feels safer than the original and I’m sorry about that. But ‘Zootopia 2’ \nwith its zippity-doo animation and surprises around every corner gets the job \ndone. \nAnd now on to the good stuff. Yes, both the leads are back. There’s irresistible \nGinnifer Goodwin voicing Judy Hopps, a farm rabbit with 225 siblings who’s now \na kickass cop in Zootopia, a gorgeously designed barnyard metropolis where \npredators and prey live in segregated harmony. I didn’t say peace; the town isn’t \nperfect.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nEnter snarkmeister Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde, a scammer of a fox who’s \nreformed so much that he too is now a cop, playing naughty to Judy’s nice. \nThere’s some flirting to suggest a mixed-species connection. But this isn’t a \nNetflix holidays romcom. And they bicker up a storm, like Blake Lively and Justin \nBaldoni behind the scenes on “It Ends with Us.” \n \nSomething must be done, so Chief Bogo (a cape buffalo again voiced by Idris \nElba) orders them to a “partners in crisis” workshop led by Dr. Fuzzby (Quinta \nBrunson) a therapy quokka. \nThis sounds a bit conventional, compared to the first movie when predators \nreverted to nature and went on snarling, violent attacks that were savage enough \nto make impressionable tots hide under their seats. Also, there are fewer movie \nreferences, though a chase through a hedge maze has a chilly “Shining” vibe. \nYou’ll be pleased to know there is a villain. So come on down Gary De’Snake, a \nreptile graced with the vocal chops of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” Oscar \nwinner Ke Huy Quan. But hold the hisses. Gary doesn’t slither with evil for long. \nSee it turns out that Gary only wants to restore the reputation of his family and \nother vipers who feel slimed by cancel culture. \nThings converge at a Zootennial Gala, celebrating 100 years since the city's \nfounding. The party is hosted by a family of lynxes who are descendants of \nZootopia's founder, Ebeneezer Lynxley. Judy befriends young Pawbert Lynxley \n(Andy Samberg) and his daddy, Milton (shaded with just the right degree of \nsuspicion by David Strathairn). \nThe plot is a needlessly complicated affair about weather walls—each animal \nspecies needs its own weather—and who owns the patent. Wait, what! A kiddie \ncomedy about patent law? Yawn, right. Hold on. Soon Judy and Nick are being \nframed as accomplices. They get help from Nibbles Maplestick (a scene stealing \nFortune Feimster), a beaver conspiracy theory podcaster who knows where the \nbodies are buried in this deceptively happy town. \nSo “Zootopia 2,” directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard—Bush did the\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nscript— puts Judy and Nick on a race to clear their names. Some mystery, as if \nwe didn’t know the outcome. It doesn’t matter. Not really. Not when Bush and \nHoward keep the action hopping with characters we’ve come to know and love. \nEven Gary De’Snake. All the voice actors have a blast cutting loose, even Shakira \nwho returns as the pop star Gazelle, with a new song called “Zoo” that seems \nbuilt for endless kiddie streaming. \nDitto the movie. OK, the sequel feels safer than the original and I’m sorry about \nthat. But “Zootopia 2” with its zippity-doo animation and surprises around every \ncorner gets the job done. The delight and dazzle of this family-friendly follow-up \nis undeniable, bringing it all home in a climax that should have audiences \npanting for a “Z3.” Forgive my Nick-like snark, but hasn’t that been the point all \nalong?\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_45a34423"}
